"""
Originality Score
=================

This package provides utilities for measuring the diversity of textual datasets and
computing a simple "Human Signal Score".  The intent is to offer an open and
transparent way to estimate the risk of model collapse due to training on
lowâ€“diversity or synthetic data.

See the README for details on how the metrics are calculated.
